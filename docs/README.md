## About This Site <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This site is the documentary support for the themes made by Pedro Moreno, under the BirdyDesign brand.
Here you will find, in addition to the information contained in the Grav theme repositories on GitHub, other complementary information that I have believed to be convenient and interesting for all those who decide to install BirdyDesign themes.
